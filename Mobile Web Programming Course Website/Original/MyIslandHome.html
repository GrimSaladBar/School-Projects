                <h1> About Barbados </h1>
                <p> Barbados is a coral island, pushed out of sea by volcanic activity in a far away time. On the West Coast of Barbados,coralshore beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe the Barbados shoreline to provide excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breezes of the trade winds give Barbados a mild and pleasant tropical climate </p>
