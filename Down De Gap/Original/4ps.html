                <h1 class = "styledMainHeading"> Our 4Ps Marketing Strategy </h1>
                <h1 class = "textShadowBlue"> Overview </h1>
                    <p> Down De' Gap's target market primarily includes tourists looking to experience local cuisine and young individuals, from the Gen Z and Millennial age groups, but also includes parents of children seeking for convenient food deliveries. Down De Gap establishes a unique position in the market as we aim to service tourists and promote smaller food businesses as compared to other competitors in the market such as Hopscotch.  Down De Gap plans for its brand to be recognized for its quick, reliable and customer friendly service. “We go down de gap, so you don't have to! </p>
                <h1 class = "textShadowBlue"> Product </h1>
                    <p> Down De Gap's main services include promoting, advertising, and recommending food businesses and delivering food and related items to clients/consumers. One problem the company will experience is obtaining market share and differentiating its service from competitors. Industry giants like Hopscotch leave little room to establish a stable consumer base as people are more likely to trust and use a familiar name than to take chances on unknown startups. In addition to offering discounts with consistent use of the service, we aim to provide a more social media friendly interface where users are able to see client reviews, recommendation and trending restaurants and dishes. This aims to attract customers and encourage them to continue to use our service and through reference accounts we aim to build trust and brand loyalty by targeting customer satisfaction. </p>
                <h1 class = "textShadowBlue"> Price </h1>
                    <p> To garner interest and allow the company to compete in the market, Down De Gap intends to charge modestly below market value but increase pricing as our consumer base increases. This accompanies the risk of being unable to “break even” or make a profit in the early stages of the business and there is no guarantee that lowering pricing will result in increased traffic and sales. During this time, to compensate for the potential losses incurred, we intend to provide in-depth, helpful information to users, create and be active in communities and utilize reference accounts to firmly establish trust and customer loyalty. Cost-based pricing will be used to fairly charge for distance travelled and time taken while also reducing the cost where wait times were unreasonable. </p>
                <h1 class = "textShadowBlue"> Promotion </h1>
                    <p> The business will be promoted primarily via low-cost strategies like social media and guerilla marketing.
                <br>
                    Social media will be used by creating and frequently posting to official business accounts established on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Any deals, specials and discounts will be actively disclosed to followers and the company will eagerly interact with followers and aim to answer most questions while also paying close attention to and utilizing trends to create a vibrant community with high levels of engagement.
                    Guerilla Marketing will be used to ensure that we stand out and gain attention so that we are able to advertise the company for relatively low costs. Partners will traverse while wearing a company shirt and actively engage with the public in order to hand out business cards and spread general information on the business. We aim to hand out coupon codes which discount your first purchase to entice potential consumers to use our service while offering temporary additional benefits to them. Using guerilla marketing the company will place partners in moderate to highly trafficked areas such as malls to attract attention and also use posters and displays to clearly express the business. </p>
                <h1 class = "textShadowBlue"> Overview </h1>
                    <p> Down De Gap will offer its services to clients directly through an online medium being a webpage. This comes with issues as the maintenance and cost of the website falls upon the partners of the company. The cost of the website can be circumvented by placing advertisement of complementary services and products from other businesses to procure additional income. </p>
